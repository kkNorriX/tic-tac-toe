# Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This is a C++ implementation of an advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring:

- Multiple game modes: Player vs Player, Player vs Random, Player vs AI
- Variable piece sizes and capturing rules
- Simple AI using board evaluation logic
- Modular design with clean code structure


## Files

- `main.cpp` — Entry point of the program. Handles the game menu and overall flow.
- `ticTacToe.hpp / cpp` — Core board logic, including:
  - Piece representation (S/M/L for X and O)
  - Board structure and status
  - Move validation, win checking, and turn handling
- `gameModes.hpp / cpp` — Implements four different game modes:
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs Random
  - Player vs Algorithm
  - Random vs Algorithm (for testing)
- `testCases.hpp / cpp` — Test scenarios simulating various gameplay situations to verify logic correctness.
